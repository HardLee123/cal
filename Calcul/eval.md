## Evaluation

Compiles.

Crashes on input if there is whitespace in the output.

## Comments

No documentation... It's hard to understand what the different parts
of the program do without comments explaining them.

Be consistent with naming (capitalization). Also, two-letter class names
easily clash with two letter variable names. I suggest longer names
for types.

You have a function that does not return a value.
